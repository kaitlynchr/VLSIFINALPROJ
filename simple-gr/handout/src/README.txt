What is the purpose of each of the 3 stages in this routing alogrithm? How are they different from each other? How do they work together as flow?
The purpose of the 3 stages first to ensure that a solution is found, and then to ensure the best solution is found.  The first stage is just to get it routed.  The next part is to find the problems and blockages and fix it so that
it can be routed. It is also to take wires that are in the way of other wires and replace them. The final is to check and find the optimal route of the wires. 

How does SimpleGr build a framework to allow the 3 stages?
It starts out with the intital routing, then it does the RRR, and it ends with greedy to ensure the least amount of wires
